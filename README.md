Steps to Run CRUD Application Project
Step 1: 
===
Set Up Frontend (React.js)
Create Directory and Initialize React App
Navigate to the main project directory where you want the frontend to be located:
bash
Copy code
mkdir client
cd client
Use npx to create a React app:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app .

Step 2: 
====
Install Necessary Dependencies
Navigate to the Client Directory

Make sure youâ€™re in the frontend (client) directory.
Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install any additional packages you need for your project:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Common dependencies might include axios for API requests, react-router-dom for routing, and react-hot-toast for notifications, for example:
bash
Copy code
npm install axios react-router-dom react-hot-toast

Step 3:
===
Fetch APIs from Backend to Frontend
Set Up API Endpoints

In your frontend React app, create services or functions to fetch data from the backend API (e.g., using axios).
Example setup in a services/api.js file:
javascript
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';

export const createUser = (data) => axios.post(`${API_URL}/create`, data);
export const getUsers = () => axios.get(`${API_URL}/users`);
// Add other API functions as needed
Update Environment Variables (Optional)

You can store your API base URL in an .env file in the frontend root directory:
env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
Access it in your code with process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL.

Step 4:
===
Run the Application
Start Frontend and Backend Servers

Frontend: Open a terminal, navigate to the client directory, and run:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Backend: Open a new terminal, navigate to the server directory, and run:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the Application

The frontend should be available at http://localhost:3000, and it will communicate with the backend at http://localhost:8000.
